-- Create the Employee table
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    birthday DATE,
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Insert 50 records into the Employee table (assuming data is obtained from Mockaroo)
-- Replace the VALUES with actual data obtained from Mockaroo
INSERT INTO Employee (id, name, birthday, email) VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', '1990-05-15', 'john.doe@example.com'),
(2, 'Jane Smith', '1985-09-20', 'jane.smith@example.com'),
... -- Add other 48 records here;

-- Update operations based on each column
-- For example, let's update the first row
UPDATE Employee SET name = 'Michael Brown' WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE Employee SET birthday = '1988-03-25' WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE Employee SET email = 'michael.brown@example.com' WHERE id = 1;

-- Delete operations based on each column
-- For example, let's delete the row with id = 1
DELETE FROM Employee WHERE id = 1;
